# hello-world

hiiiiii

I'm Jaycee.. I'm just now starting my journey to learn how to code so take it easy on me. D:
Jumping spider and roller skates and jumping spiders on roller skates are my personal interests.

Other than that I attempt to navigate the CRC at KU using Linux commands and tell it what to do using batch files.
 (oh yea that's bc I use it to run ORCA for DFT calculations)

~someday we will return to whence we formed~
